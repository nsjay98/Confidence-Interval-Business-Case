# Overview:
This project analyzes customer purchase behavior at Walmart during Black Friday, focusing on understanding spending patterns based on gender, marital status, and age demographics. The analysis employs statistical techniques including the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), Bootstrapping, and Confidence Intervals to derive meaningful insights.

# Dataset:
The dataset used for this analysis contains transactional data of customers who made purchases at Walmart stores during Black Friday. It includes features such as User ID, Product ID, Gender, Age, Occupation, City Category, Stay in Current City Years, Marital Status, Product Category, and Purchase Amount.

# Analysis Steps:
* Data Exploration: Examined the dataset structure, checked for null values, and detected outliers using boxplots and statistical methods.
* Gender-based Analysis: Calculated average spending for male and female customers, computed Confidence Intervals using CLT and Bootstrapping, and analyzed the results.
* Marital Status and Age Analysis: Extended the analysis to explore spending patterns based on marital status and age demographics, providing recommendations based on the findings.

# Files Included:
* walmart_data.csv: The dataset used for analysis.
* Business_Case_Confidence_Interval_and_CLT.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code.
* README.md: This README file providing project overview, analysis steps, results, and recommendations.
